## What are Signals?

### Dictionary definitions

> Noun: 'anything agreed upon or understood as the occasion for concerted action'

> Adjective: 'unusual; notable; outstanding'

> Verb: 'to communicate or make known by a signal'

> 'The fundamental quantity of representing some information'.

### Signal definition

Signals are simple messages that can be exchanged between organisations to indicate that an action has been taken or that something has been decided or agreeed upon.

With signals insight is moved (the result of deploying expertise over raw data) not the raw data itself. This has many benefits.

## Why Signals? (General problems we are solving)

* Signals are light-weight, with simple payloads and a straightforward version control system. This means it will be less expensive to experiment with new types of information exchange and that signals can be revised, or new signals added, without disrupting existing implementations 
* Signals can be delivered as soon as a corresponding event occurs in the originating business process.  We believe this will allow new workflows to be created based on actual business timings rather than any arbitrary cadence imposed by parties who are collaborating in information exchange
* Signals can move in any direction multilaterally, creating the potential for feedback loops that are difficult to create with current information units

## What are the features of a well designed signal?
- Signals permit organisations to minimise information share volume while maximising the sharing of expertise
- Signals are typically self contained - they usually do not require additional out of band information to be made available
- Signals reduce the need for complex ontologies and reduce semantics leaking over boundaries due to their more precise/targetted deisgn and footprint
- Signals may be anonymous/opaque - identity of the producer/provider may be omitted
- Signals permit consuming parties to make their own minds up on whether and how to use them for example whether aggregation or corroboration are necessary
- Signals may move bi-directionally between any number of entities participating in a network
- A signal is typically not a large footprint of raw information

## What data should be contained in a signal?
- A signal is typically:
  - An attribute of an event or information element
  - A verified attribute of an event or information element
  - An opinion based on observation of information or events
  - A claim based on analysis of information or events
  - Insight generated by the deployment of expertise over data or events
  - An attestation from an organisation that a signal produced or provided by another organisation is accurate or true

## Which elements and attributes are needed to define a signal?

A non exhaustive starter for ten.

```clojure
{
  :start "2022-03-01T09:00:00.000Z" [1]
  :end "2023-03-31T17:30:00.000Z" [2]
  :priority 5 [3]
  :matching-construct "1c002dd4b5" [4]
  :correlation-id "734713bc04" [5]
  :category "positive-profile" [6]
  :name "Structurally damaged container lorem ipsum" [7]
  :description "The container is caved in - environmental housing destroyed lorem ipsum" [8]
}
```

- 1: An instant from which the signal should be considered valid
- 2: An instant at which the signal should be expired and removed from operational surfaces; dashboards etc
- 3: A priority indicating how important the signal is (various swappable systems for this will be necessary)
- 4: A possibly composite matching construct which relates the signal to information in a consortium EoT instance system
- 5: A unique identifier which lets all actors using and adding to a signal understand they are operating on the same signal (traces through workflows)
- 6: Category used to indicate what kind of signal is being transmitted _or_ if the signal is uplifted from a specific trade or other recognised event
- 7: A simple name to represent the signal where it is placed adjacent to others (human readable and meaningful)
- 8: A more meaningful and full explanation of the signal's purpose (to be disdovered how meaning may be encoded into this)
